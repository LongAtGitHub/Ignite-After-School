Some assumption to be made
## Assumption 1

Assume that all of the following counts as afterschool activities:
- I stay at my school or go to another school \
- My home or another home such as a friend's, relative's or neighbor's \
- A rec, community or other youth center \
- A park or other outdoor space \
- A library \
- A church, synagogue, mosque, or other spiritual/religious place \ 

These are A34A, A34B, A34C,.. A34F in the table.
A34 value
1-	0 days
2-	1 day
3-	2 days
4-	3 to 4 days
5-	5 days

So
```{r}
mutate(
    across(starts_with("A34"), ~replace_na(., 0)),
    afterschool = if_else(A34A > 3 | A34B > 3 | A34C > 3 | A34D > 3 | A34E > 3 | A34F > 3, TRUE, FALSE)
```


## Assumption 2
Above, I made an assumption that if a box is left NA, then it will default to 0 so easier computation, hence 
```{r}
across(starts_with("A34"), ~replace_na(., 0)),
```

across(starts_with("A34"), ~replace_na(., 0)),
