## Project Background

For our project, we have partnered with Ignite Afterschool, an education and advocacy non-profit based in the Twin Cities, to update data briefs that they create for parents and the general public. We have utilized the Minnesota Student Survey to provide answers about after school engagement and outcomes across Minnesota which included analysis of disparities based on race, income, and region.

Our objectives for this project were:

1.  What information is available in the MSS (Minnesota Student Survey) and how can we use it to update the existing briefs?

2.  What other information may be helpful to ignite afterschool’s data briefs and how should we present our findings to them?

3.  What questions on the survey relate to the recent legalization of cannabis in Minnesota? Are there other sources we could draw from to supplement the MSS?

Our questions were largely determined based on Ignite’s needs which were to update the existing briefs using the 2022 survey and have an understanding of what data was available including any information that may be relevant to the recent legalization of cannabis in Minnesota. We first identified variables of interest including race, variables related to being connected to a caring adult, engaging in after school activities 3 times a week, resource related variables, and region. We then found the variables related to drug and alcohol use and presented the available questions to Ignite.

## Data Context

Our main data source for this project was the Minnesota Student Survey from 2022. According to the Minnesota Department of Education, the Minnesota Student Survey is one of the longest-running youth surveys in the United States. It is an anonymous statewide survey that is given to grades five, eight, nine, and eleven to gain insight into student experiences. For this project, we will be using the survey collected online by the state of Minnesota in collaboration with local schools in 2022. 

The survey is taken every three years with changes made between each one such as wording or new questions. In every administration of the survey at least 81% of schools in Minnesota have participated, in 2022 there were approximately 135,000 individual responses (observations). 

The results of the survey are posted publicly and used by non-state groups to assess student needs and hold public discussions. The state uses the data “to monitor trends, to assess the extent of disparities among population groups, to obtain federal and state funding, and to assist local communities and schools.” <https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/health/mss/mde059027> 

## Analysis

The first steps we had to take involved parsing through the large data dictionary and using two different csv files, one that included included county data but not race, and one that included race but no county data. We then group the observations by regions so that Ignite would be able to create regional briefs similar to the ones they have previously published. Below is a table that displays the regions:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
survey <- read_csv("result/region_percent_survey.csv")
survey
```

Our project involved quite a bit of wrangling, as the questions Ignite wanted to answer in the briefs were not directly asked in the survey. For example, to determine if a student was engaged 3 or more times a week, we had to create a new variable that took into account a variety of engagement types. For our investigation of income we used the answers to questions about having enough food and stable shelter to determine if a student was low income or not. This process involved us communicating with Ignite to make these choices. but some assumptions were our own which we documented in the brief construction process.

### Engaged After school

We calculated if students did at least one of the following activities at least 3 times a week:

1.  stay at my school or go to another school
2.  My home or another home such as a friend's, relative's or neighbor's
3.  A rec, community or other youth center
4.  A park or other outdoor space
5.  A library
6.   A church, synagogue, mosque, or other spiritual/religious place  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
afterschoolx3 <- read_csv("result/clean_afterschool_x3_report.csv")
afterschoolx3
```

#### By Race

```{r, cho=FALSE, message=FALSE}
race <- read_csv("result/race_ethnicity.csv")
race

```

### Caring Adults

Answer of "quite a bit" or "very much" to EITHER of A56D(Teachers) or A56E(Other adults at school), which asks how much you feel a specific group cares about you

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
caring <- read_csv("result/clean_caringadult_report.csv")
caring
```

### Income

Skipping meals and experiencing homelessness were used as a proxy for being low income. We also attempted to use resources like access to a laptop or tablet as a proxy, but found a similar study used these variables instead. Ensuring that this was the same way Ignite previously calculated low vs. high income is unfortunately outside of the scope of this project.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
income <- read_csv("result/income.csv")
income
```

### The Cannabis Report

In MSS we identified the following key questions in line with Ignite's goals for expanding their cannabis education programming:

1.  **Any alcohol and/or other drug** used during the past year
2.  *During the last 12 months, **have you used marijuana** (pot, weed) or hashish (hash, hash oil) (*
3.  *During the last 12 months on **how many occasions** (if any) have you used marijuana or hashish? (Do not count medical marijuana prescribed for you by a doctor)*
4.  During the last 12 months, on how many occasions (if any) have you used **synthetic marijuana** that you took **only to get high**
5.  *How much do you think people **risk harming themselves** physically or in other ways if they **use marijuana once or twice per week***

We prioritized answering questions 3 and 5 per Ignite's request and found that for question 3 there was very little variance in frequency of use across race and region as almost all students selected 0 times or not applicable.

### Question 3

##### *During the last 12 months on **how many occasions** (if any) have you used marijuana or hashish? (Do not count medical marijuana prescribed for you by a doctor)*

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
raceQ3 <- read_csv("result/report_3_race.csv")

data_long <- pivot_longer(raceQ3, cols = -Race, names_to = "Time", values_to = "Percentage")

# Convert Percentage to numeric
data_long$Percentage <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", data_long$Percentage)) / 100

#convert race number to name
data_long <- data_long %>%
  mutate(Race = case_when(
    Race == 1 ~ "American Indian or Alaskan Native only",
    Race == 2 ~ "Asian or Asian American only",
    Race == 3 ~ "Black, African or African American only",
    Race == 4 ~ "Hispanic or Latino/a only",
    Race == 5 ~ "Middle Eastern or North African",
    Race == 6 ~ "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander only",
    Race == 7 ~ "White only",
    Race == 8 ~ "Multiple Races",
    Race == 9 ~ "No answer"))


#visualization
race_q3_plot <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Time, y = Percentage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~Race) +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Percentage") +
  ggtitle("Marijuana Use in the Past 12 Months by Race") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + # Rotate x-axis labels vertically
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1))

```

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
regionQ3 <- read_csv("result/report_3_region.csv")
data_long <- pivot_longer(regionQ3, cols = -Region, names_to = "Time", values_to = "Percentage")

# Convert Percentage to numeric
data_long$Percentage <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", data_long$Percentage)) / 100

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1))

region_q3_plot
```

### Question 5

##### *How much do you think people **risk harming themselves** physically or in other ways if they **use marijuana once or twice per week***

For question 5 we found that there is a larger amount of girls (37%) than boys (33%) who consider others using marijuana two or more times a week a "Great" risk to their health.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
make_pie_chart <- function(slices, title){
lbls <- c("No Risk", "Slight", "Moderate", "Great", "NA")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
# add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),   main= title) }

par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) 
make_pie_chart(c(11.89, 3.14, 9.7, 32.64, 42.63), "Boys")
make_pie_chart(c(9.33, 3.83,    11.16,  37.46,  38.22), "Girls")

```

For results based on race we see 3 main categories.

#### Highest Perception of risk:

White only, Asian or Asian American only and multiple races all had a greater amount of students who considered others using marijuana two or more times a week a "Great" risk to their health ranging.

#### Lowest Perception of risk or not applicable:

American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders in comparison had much lower amounts of students responding "Great" risk with more students selecting not applicable. It is important to note that these two racial groups are the smallest out of all respondents.

#### Moderate Perception of risk:

Black, African or African American only, Hispanic or Latino/a only, and Middle Eastern or North African respondents were some where between the previous groups with lower levels of not applicable responses, but also lower levels of "Great" responses.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3)) # Set up a 1x3 grid for plots
plot7 <- make_pie_chart(c(9.92, 3.66, 11.16, 39.54, 35.72), "White only")
plot2 <- make_pie_chart(c(12.8, 3.53, 11.09, 35.4, 37.19), "Asian or Asian American only")
plot8 <- make_pie_chart(c(10.37,3.7,11.12,33.93, 40.89), "Multiple Races")
par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) 
# Set up a 1x2 grid for plots
plot1 <- make_pie_chart(c(11.98,3.93, 6.96, 14.29, 62.84), "American Indian or Alaskan Native only")
plot6 <- make_pie_chart(c(17.39, 2.48, 6.21, 12.11, 61.8), "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander only")
par(mfrow=c(1, 3)) 
# Set up a 1x3 grid for plots
plot3 <- make_pie_chart(c(12.19, 2.1, 6.54, 22, 57.18), "Black, African or African American only")
plot4 <- make_pie_chart(c(14.72, 3.99, 10.13, 24.44, 46.71), "Hispanic or Latino/a only")
plot5 <- make_pie_chart(c(10.03, 2.44, 7.74, 27.22, 52.58), "Middle Eastern or North African")
plot9 <- make_pie_chart(c(3.97, 1.12, 3.61, 10.41, 80.89), "No answer")
```

Students who did not answer the race question, also tended to select not applicable to the 5th cannabis question.

## Main Takeaways and Future Directions

This project is important for understanding youth behaviors, opinions, and their involvement with after school activities. New developments reflected in this survey are the COVID-19 pandemic and the legalization of cannabis in Minnesota. Our analysis updates the already known disparities in after school participation across race and class. Additionally, we find that cannabis usage amongst youth does not very significantly by race or region, but we did find that youth opinions on the risk of cannabis use does vary slightly by sex, with girls viewing usage as a greater risk than boys. We also see that across racial groups there is quite a bit of variation with some groups answering that there is a "Great" risk but ultimately the groups that did not rate the risk as high opted instead to select not applicable.

Our project addressed key areas of the current Ignite Afterschool data briefs, but with the constraints of our project we were not able to reproduce all of the data required. In order to complete the briefs one would have to clarify and correct if necessary the assumptions made in the wrangling and calculation process.
